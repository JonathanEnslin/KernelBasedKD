Analysis was performed on the mean of the teacher and student model weights as a whole and as a group, further, the mean of the absolute values of the weights were also taken to compare the magnitude

S1 and T1 mean was without the abs values
S2 and T1 was with the abs values
_# is the index of the layer groups, or alternatively all the model weights together when no index was present
